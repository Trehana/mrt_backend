# Singapore MRT Backend API

The API is based on Rails 5 API to find and display one or more routes from a specified origin to a specified destination, ordered by Shortest Path and Time consideration

## Setting up Rails 5

First, make sure you are running Ruby 2.2.2+ or newer as itâ€™s required by Rails 5.

* Addtional Configurations Used
## Serializing API Output
To control what data gets served through the API i have used Active Model Serializers
```
gem 'active_model_serializers'
```
I have serialized User Model

## Enabling CORS
To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), in order to make cross-origin AJAX requests possible
I have added 
```ruby
gem 'rack-cors'
```

## Rate Limiting and Throttling
To protect API from DDoS, brute force attacks. I have used `Rack::Attack`

```ruby
gem 'rack-attack'
```
